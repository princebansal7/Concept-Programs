<summary> ABOUT XOR </summary>


#### ABOUT XOR (^) Operator:

    
    1. XOR of 2 Same = 0
    2. XOR of 2 Differents = 1
        eg: 1^0 = 1
            0^1 = 1
            1^1 = 0
            0^0 = 0
    3. If there are mulitple values getting XORed:
          - if number of 1 is odd => 1 (ans)
          - if number of 1 is even => 0 (ans)
        eg: 1^1^0 = 0
            1^1^1^0 = 1
            1^1^1 = 1
            1^1^1^1 = 0
            0^0^0^0 = 0

        Similarly:
            - XOR of same number even number of times => 0 (ans)
            - XOR of same number Odd number of times => same number (ans)
        eg: 4^4^0 = 0
            4^4^4 = 4
            4^4^4^0 = 4
            4^4^4^4 = 0

<summary>About Queues</summary>

There are many variations of Queue:
1. Dequeue (IMP)
2. Priority Queue (IMP): (every element have priority, one highest priority one gets deleted 1st always)
3. Insertion Restrcited queue (insertion happens at only one end, deletions happens on both)
4. Deletion Restricted queue  (deletion happens at only one end, insertuons happens on both)

----------Dequeue (pronounced as Deck)-------------------
Alternative names:Head-Tail queue
Double ended Queue
Insertion and Deletion is Possible on Both ends
